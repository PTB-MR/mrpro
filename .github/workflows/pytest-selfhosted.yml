# You need to run a self-hosted runner to run this workflow.
# The `mrpro_runner` package is a docker image containing all necessary software
# For automated self-hosted runner registration you need to create an organization fine-granted token
# with the "Administration:write" and "Self-hosted runners:write".
#
# The following environmental variables need to be set:
# GITHUB_PERSONAL_TOKEN - the organization token
# GITHUB_OWNER - the organization (PTB-MR) in this particular case.
#
# I would recommend to save this variables to a text file named `runner.env` at the host machine with following content:
# GITHUB_PERSONAL_TOKEN=XXX
# GITHUB_OWNER=PTB-MR
#
# Run with docker:
# docker run --gpus <GPU_ID> --env-file runner.env ghcr.io/ptb-mr/mrpro_runner:latest
#
# Run with singularity:
# You can convert the existing docker container to the singularity container via:
# singularity build --fix-perms mrpro-runner.sif docker://ghcr.io/ptb-mr/mrpro_runner:latest
# Hint: use SINGULARITY_CACHE=... environmental variable for cache
#
# When build is ready you can launch this singularity container via:
# NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<GPU_ID> singularity run --nv --env-file runner.env --pwd /actions-runner --writable-tmpfs --contain mrpro-runner.sif
#
# If you want to run the singularity container in ephemeral mode (one runner - one job) you need to specify a unique id for each runner
# as an extra argument to the singularity command:
# NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<GPU_ID> singularity exec --nv --env-file runner.env --pwd /actions-runner --writable-tmpfs --contain mrpro-runner.sif /actions-runner/entrypoint.sh 123456
#
# Use the ./github/slurm_dispatcher.py to dispatch each job to the isolated singularity container
