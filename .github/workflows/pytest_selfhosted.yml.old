# You need to run a self-hosted runner to run this workflow.
# The `mr2_runner` package is a docker image containing all necessary software
# For automated self-hosted runner registration you need to create an organization fine-granted token
# with the "Administration:write" and "Self-hosted runners:write".
#
# The following variables need to be provided to the runner:
# the 1st positional argument -
# RUNNER_TOKEN - the runner registration token,
# (see https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/self-hosted-runners?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-registration-token-for-an-organization)
# the 2nd positional argument -
# GITHUB_OWNER - the organization (fzimmermann89) in this particular case.
# the 3d positional argument (optional)
# RUN_ID - if set - the runner starts in ephemeral mode and terminates after run is finished, otherwise - runs in continuous mode.
#
#
# Run with docker:
# docker run --gpus <GPU_ID> ghcr.io/fzimmermann89/mr2_runner:latest RUNNER_TOKEN GITHUB_OWNER [RUN_ID]
#
# Run with singularity:
# You can convert the existing docker container to the singularity container via:
# singularity build --fix-perms mr2-runner.sif docker://ghcr.io/fzimmermann89/mr2_runner:latest
# Hint: use SINGULARITY_CACHE=... environmental variable for cache
#
# When build is ready you can launch this singularity container via:
# NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<GPU_ID> singularity run --nv --pwd /actions-runner --writable-tmpfs --contain mr2-runner.sif\
# /actions-runner/entrypoint.sh RUNNER_TOKEN GITHUB_OWNER [RUN_ID]
#
#
# Schedule the cron job for ./github/slurm_cronjob.py to dispatch each job to the isolated singularity container.
