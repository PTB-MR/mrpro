        The MSE functional is given by
        :math:`f: C^N \rightarrow [0, \infty), x \rightarrow 1/N \| W (x-b)\|_2^2`,
        where :math:`W` is either a scalar or tensor that corresponds to a (block-) diagonal operator
        that is applied to the input. The division by `N` can be disabled by setting `divide_by_n` to `False`.
        For more details also see :class:`mrpro.operators.functionals.L2NormSquared`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        target
            target element - often data tensor (see above)
        weight
            weight parameter (see above)
        dim
            dimension(s) over which functional is reduced.
            All other dimensions of  `weight ( x - target)` will be treated as batch dimensions.
        divide_by_n
            If `True`, the result is scaled by the number of elements of the dimensions in the
            tensor `weight ( x - target)` indexed by `dim`. The functional is thus calculated as the mean, else the sum.
        keepdim
            If `True`, the dimension(s) of the input indexed by dim are maintained and collapsed to singeltons,
            else they are removed from the result.

        Calculates :math:`1/N \| W * (x - b) \|_2^2`, where :math:`W` is `weight`,
        :math:`b` is `target`, and `N` is the number of elements over which the
        mean is computed (if `divide_by_n` is `True` at initialization of L2NormSquared).
        The squared norm is computed along dimensions specified by `dim`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x
            Input tensor.

        Returns
        -------
            The MSE. If `keepdim` is `True`, the dimensions `dim` are retained
            with size 1; otherwise, they are reduced.
