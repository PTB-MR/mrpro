    """Numerical simulation of 2D Birdcage coil sensitivities.

    This function is strongly inspired by ISMRMRD Python Tools [ISMc]_. The associated license
    information can be found at the end of this file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    number_of_coils
        number of coil elements
    image_dimensions
        number of voxels in the image
        This is a 2D simulation so the output will be (1 number_of_coils 1 image_dimensions.y image_dimensions.x)
    relative_radius
        relative radius of birdcage
    normalize_with_rss
        If set to true, the calculated sensitivities are normalized by the root-sum-of-squares
