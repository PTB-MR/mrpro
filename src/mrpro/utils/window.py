    """Sliding window view into the tensor x.

    Returns a view into the tensor x that represents a sliding window.
    The window-axes will be at the end in the order of the axis argument.
    Non-overlapping windows can be achieved by setting the strides to the window_shape.
    Note that the stride argument is **experimental** and not fully supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x
        Tensor to slide over
    window_shape
        Size of window over each axis that takes part in the sliding window.
    axis
        Axis or axes to slide over. If None, slides over all axes.
    strides
        Stride of the sliding window. **Experimental**.
