# ### Image reconstruction
# We use the `~mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.RegularizedIterativeSENSEReconstruction` class to reconstruct images
# from 2D radial data. It solves the following reconstruction problem:
#
# Let's assume we have obtained the k-space data $y$ from an image $x$ with an acquisition model (Fourier transforms,
# coil sensitivity maps...) $A$ then we can formulate the forward problem as:
#
# $ y = Ax + n $
#
# where $n$ describes complex Gaussian noise. The image $x$ can be obtained by minimizing the functionl $F$
#
# $ F(x) = ||W^{\frac{1}{2}}(Ax - y)||_2^2 $
#
# where $W^\frac{1}{2}$ is the square root of the density compensation function (which corresponds to a diagonal
# operator). Because this is an ill-posed problem, we can add a regularization term to stabilize the problem and obtain
# a solution with certain properties:
#
# $ F(x) = ||W^{\frac{1}{2}}(Ax - y)||_2^2 + l||Bx - x_{reg}||_2^2$
#
# where $l$ is the strength of the regularization, $B$ is a linear operator and $x_{reg}$ is a regularization image.
# With this functional $F$ we obtain a solution which is close to $x_{reg}$ and to the acquired data $y$.
#
# Setting the derivative of the functional $F$ to zero and rearranging yields
#
# $ (A^H W A + l B) x = A^H W y + l x_{reg}$
#
# which is a linear system $Hx = b$ that needs to be solved for $x$.
#
# One important question of course is, what to use for $x_{reg}$. For dynamic images (e.g. cine MRI) low-resolution
# dynamic images or high-quality static images have been proposed. In recent years, also the output of neural-networks
# has been used as an image regulariser.
#
# In this example we are going to use a high-quality image to regularize the reconstruction of an undersampled image.
# Both images are obtained from the same data acquisition (one using all the acquired data ($x_{reg}$) and one using
# only parts of it ($x$)). This of course is an unrealistic case but it will allow us to study the effect of the
# regularization.

# ### Reading of both fully sampled and undersampled data
# We read the raw data and the trajectory from the ISMRMRD file.
# We load both, the fully sampled and the undersampled data.
# The fully sampled data will be used to estimate the coil sensitivity maps and as a regularization image.
# The undersampled data will be used to reconstruct the image.

# a neural network to estimate the regularization image.

# to build your own reconstruction pipeline.

# ##### Set-up the linear self-adjoint operator $H$
# We define $H = A^H A + \lambda$. We can use `~mrpro.operators.LinearOperator.gram` to get an efficient
# implementation of $A^H A$. We use the `~mrpro.operators.IdentityOp` and make
# use of operator addition using ``+`` and multiplication using ``*``.
# The resulting operator is a `~mrpro.operators.LinearOperator` object.

# We solve the linear system $Hx = b$ using the conjugate gradient method.

# the residual is small enough.

# ### Next steps
#
# We are cheating here because we used the fully sampled image as a regularization. In real world applications
# we would not have that. One option is to apply a low-pass filter to the undersampled k-space data to try to reduce the
# streaking artifacts and use that as a regularization image. Try that and see if you can also improve the image quality
# compared to the unregularised images.
