# # Proximal gradient descent (FISTA) reconstruction of 2D golden angle radial data
# Here, we use a proximal gradient descent algorithm to reconstruct an image
# from 2D radial k-space data with wavelet regularization.
# In particular, we use the accelerated version known as FISTA (Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm)
# [Beck \& Teboulle, SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences 2009].
#
# Let $y$ denote the k-space data of the image $x_{\mathrm{true}}$ sampled with an acquisition model $A$
# (Fourier transform, coil sensitivity maps, etc.), i.e the forward problem is given as
#
# $ y = Ax_{\mathrm{true}} + n, $
#
# where $n$ describes complex Gaussian noise.
# An approximation of $x_{\mathrm{true}}$ can be carried out exploiting
# the fact that wavelets provide a sparse representation of images
# by minimizing
# the following functional $\mathcal{F}$:
#
# $ \mathcal{F}(x) = \frac{1}{2}||Ax - y||_2^2 + \lambda \| W x \|_1, \quad \quad \quad (1)$
#
# where $W$ is the discretized wavelet operator that maps image domain into wavelet domain,
# and $\lambda >0$ appropriate weight.
#
# The minimization of the functional $\mathcal{F}$ is non-trivial due to
# the non-differentiable $\ell_1$-norm and the presence of the wavelet operator.
# We proceed first by reformulating $(1)$ to solve the minimization problem in the wavelet domain,
# exploiting the orthonormality of $W$.
# We set a new variable $\tilde{x} = Wx$. Thus,
# the minimization problem becomes
#
# $ \min_{\tilde{x}} \frac{1}{2}||AW^H\tilde{x} - y||_2^2 + \lambda \| \tilde{x} \|_1.  \quad \quad \quad (2)$
#
# A suitable algorithm to solve $(2)$ is the
# FISTA-algorithm, consisting in an accelerated proximal gradient descent algorithm.
# It solves problems of the form
#
# $ \min_x f(x) + g(x)  \quad \quad \quad (3)$
#
# where $f$ is a convex, differentiable function with $L$-Lipschitz gradient $\nabla f$,
# and $g$ is convex and possibly non-smooth.
#
# The main step of the minimization method is a proximal gradient step, which reads as
#
# $x_{k} = \mathrm{prox}_{\sigma g}(x_{k-1} - \sigma \nabla f({x}_{k-1}))$
#
# where $\mathrm{prox}$ denotes the proximal operator and $\sigma$ is
# an appropriate stepsize, ideally $\sigma=\frac{1}{L}$, with $L$ being
# the Lipschitz constant of $\nabla f$.
#
# In FISTA, there is an
# additional step to accelerate the convergence. The following variable $y_{k+1}$
# is added, consisting of a linear interpolation
# of the previous two steps $x_{k}$ and $x_{k-1}$. So, for $t_1=1, y_1=x_0$:
#
# $x_{k} = \mathrm{prox}_{\sigma g}(y_{k} - \sigma \nabla f({y}_{k}))$
#
# $t_{k+1} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4t_k^2}}{2}$
#
# $y_{k+1} = x_{k} + \frac{t_k - 1}{t_{k+1}}(x_{k} - x_{k-1}).$
#
# As the Lipschitz constant $L$ is in general not known, and
# the interval of the stepsize $\sigma\in ( 0, \frac{1}{|| W A^H A W^H||} )$ is crucial for the convergence,
# a backtracking step can
# be performed to update the stepsize $\sigma$ at every iteration. To do so,
# $\sigma$ is iteratively reduced until reaching a stepsize that is the biggest one
# for which the quadratic approximation of $f$ at $y_{k}$
# is an upper bound for $f(x_{k})$.
#
# Functions $f$ ang $g$ from $(3)$ can be identified as
#
# $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\|AW^Hx  - y\|_2^2,$
#
# $g(x) = \lambda \| x\|_1.$
#
# After running the algorithm for $N$ iterations, the optimal solution $x_{N}$
# is in wavelet domain and needs to be mapped back to image domain.
# Thus we apply the adjoint of the wavelet transform and obtain solution $x_{\text{opt}}$ as
#
# $x_{\text{opt}} := W^H x_{N}$.
#
# In the following, we load 2D radial MR data and set up problem (2) to use
# FISTA to reconstruct the data.


# ## Read-in the raw data
# We read the raw k-space data and the trajectory from the ISMRMRD file
# (see <project:comparison_trajectory_calculators.ipynb> for more information on the trajectory calculation).
# Our example data contains three datasets:
# - ``radial2D_402spokes_golden_angle_with_traj.h5`` with 402 spokes
# - ``radial2D_96spokes_golden_angle_with_traj.h5`` with 96 spokes
# - ``radial2D_24spokes_golden_angle_with_traj.h5`` with 24 spokes
#
# We use the 24 spokes dataset for the reconstruction.
