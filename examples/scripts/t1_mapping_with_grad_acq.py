# ### Overview
# In this acquisition, a single inversion pulse is played out, followed by a continuous data acquisition with a
# a constant flip angle $\alpha$. Data acquisition is carried out with a 2D Golden angle radial trajectory. The acquired
# data can be divided into different dynamic time frames, each corresponding to a different inversion time. A signal
# model can then be fitted to this data to obtain a $T_1$ map.
#
# More information can be found in:

# myocardial $T_1$ mapping. *Magnetic Resonance in Medicine*, 90(3):1086-1100, [10.1002/mrm.29699](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.29699)

# The number of time frames and hence the number of radial lines per time frame, can in principle be chosen arbitrarily.
# However, a tradeoff between image quality (more radial lines per dynamic) and
# temporal resolution to accurately capture the signal behavior (fewer radial lines) needs to be found.

# %% [markdown]
# During data acquisition, the magnetization $M_z(t)$ can be described by the signal model:
#
# $$
#   M_z(t) = M_0^* + (M_0^{init} - M_0^*)e^{(-t / T_1^*)} \quad (1)
# $$

# %% [markdown]
# where the effective longitudinal relaxation time is given by:
#
# $$
#   T_1^* = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_R} \ln(\cos(\alpha))}
# $$

# %% [markdown]
# and the steady-state magnetization is
#
# $$
#   M_0^* = M_0 \frac{T_1^*}{T_1} .
# $$

# %% [markdown]
# The initial magnetization $M_0^{init}$ after an inversion pulse is $-M_0$. Nevertheless, commonly after an inversion
# pulse, a strong spoiler gradient is played out to remove any residual transversal magnetization due to
# imperfections of the inversion pulse. During the spoiler gradient, the magnetization recovers with $T_1$. Commonly,
# the duration of this spoiler gradient $\Delta t$ is between 10 to 20 ms. This leads to the initial magnetization
#
# $$
#  M_0^{init} = M_0(1 - 2e^{(-\Delta t / T_1)}) .

# ### Signal model
# We use a three parameter signal model $q(M_0, T_1, \alpha)$.
#
# As known input, the model needs information about the time $t$ (`sampling_time`) in Eq. (1) since the inversion pulse.
# This can be calculated from the `acquisition_time_stamp`. If we average the `acquisition_time_stamp`-values for each
# dynamic image and subtract the first `acquisition_time_stamp`, we get the mean time since the inversion pulse for each
# dynamic. Note: The time taken by the spoiler gradient is taken into consideration in the
# `TransientSteadyStateWithPreparation`-model and does not have to be added here. Another important thing to note is
# that the `acquisition_time_stamp` is not given in time units but in vendor-specific time stamp units. For the Siemens
# data used here, one time stamp corresponds to 2.5 ms.

# %%
sampling_time = torch.mean(kdata_dynamic.header.acq_info.acquisition_time_stamp[:, 0, :, 0].to(torch.float32), dim=-1)
# Subtract time stamp of first radial line
sampling_time -= kdata_dynamic.header.acq_info.acquisition_time_stamp[0, 0, 0, 0]
# Convert to seconds
sampling_time *= 2.5 / 1000

# %% [markdown]
# We also need the repetition time between two RF-pulses. There is a parameter `tr` in the header, but this describes
# the time "between the beginning of a pulse sequence and the beginning of the succeeding (essentially identical) pulse
# sequence" (see [DICOM Standard Browser](https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/mr-image/mr-image/00180080)). We have one
# inversion pulse at the beginning, which is never repeated and hence `tr` is the duration of the entire scan.
# Therefore, we have to use the parameter `echo_spacing`, which describes the time between two gradient echoes.

# %%
if kdata_dynamic.header.echo_spacing is None:
    raise ValueError('Echo spacing needs to be defined.')
else:
    repetition_time = kdata_dynamic.header.echo_spacing[0]

# %% [markdown]
# Finally, we have to specify the duration of the spoiler gradient. Unfortunately, we cannot get this information from
# the acquired data, but we have to know the value and set it by hand to 20 ms. Now we can define the signal model.

# %%
model_op = TransientSteadyStateWithPreparation(
    sampling_time, repetition_time, m0_scaling_preparation=-1, delay_after_preparation=0.02
)

# %% [markdown]
# The reconstructed image data is complex-valued. We could fit a complex $M_0$ to the data, but in this case it is more
# robust to fit $|q(M_0, T_1, \alpha)|$ to the magnitude of the image data. We therefore combine our model with a
# `MagnitudeOp`.

# %%
magnitude_model_op = MagnitudeOp() @ model_op

# %% [markdown]
# ### Constraints
# $T_1$ and $\alpha$ need to be positive. Based on the knowledge of the phantom, we can constrain $T_1$ between 50 ms
# and 3 s. Further, we can constrain $\alpha$. Although the effective flip angle can vary, it can only vary by a
# certain percentage relative to the nominal flip angle. Here, we chose a maximum deviation from the nominal flip angle
# of 50%.

# %%
if kdata_dynamic.header.fa is None:
    raise ValueError('Nominal flip angle needs to be defined.')
else:
    nominal_flip_angle = float(kdata_dynamic.header.fa[0])

constraints_op = ConstraintsOp(bounds=((None, None), (0.05, 3.0), (nominal_flip_angle * 0.5, nominal_flip_angle * 1.5)))

# %% [markdown]
# ### Loss function
# As a loss function for the optimizer, we calculate the mean squared error between the image data $x$ and our signal
# model $q$.
# %%
mse_loss = MSE(img_rss_dynamic)

# %% [markdown]
# Now we can simply combine the loss function, the signal model and the constraints to solve
#
# $$
#  \min_{M_0, T_1, \alpha} || |q(M_0, T_1, \alpha)| - x||_2^2
# $$
# %%
functional = mse_loss @ magnitude_model_op @ constraints_op

# %% [markdown]
# ### Carry out fit

# The shortest echo time is a good approximation for the equilibrium magnetization
m0_start = img_rss_dynamic[0, ...]
# 1 s a good starting value for T1
t1_start = torch.ones(m0_start.shape, dtype=torch.float32)
# and the nominal flip angle a good starting value for the actual flip angle
flip_angle_start = torch.ones(m0_start.shape, dtype=torch.float32) * kdata_dynamic.header.fa

# ### Next steps
# The quality of the final $T_1$ maps depends on the quality of the individual dynamic images. Using more advanced image
# reconstruction methods, we can improve the image quality and hence the quality of the maps.
#
# Try to exchange `DirectReconstruction` above with `IterativeSENSEReconstruction` and compare the quality of the
# $T_1$ maps for different number of iterations (`n_iterations`).
