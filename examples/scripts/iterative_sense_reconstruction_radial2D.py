# # Iterative SENSE reconstruction of 2D golden angle radial data
# Here we use an iterative reconstruction method to reconstruct images from ISMRMRD 2D radial data.

# %% [markdown]
# We use the `~mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.IterativeSENSEReconstruction` class to solve
# the following reconstruction problem:
#
# Let's assume we have obtained the k-space data $y$ from an image $x$ with an acquisition model (Fourier transforms,
# coil sensitivity maps...) $A$ then we can formulate the forward problem as:
#
# $ y = Ax + n $
#
# where $n$ describes complex Gaussian noise. The image $x$ can be obtained by minimizing the functional $F$
#
# $ F(x) = ||Ax - y||_2^2 $
#
# Setting the derivative of the functional $F$ to zero and rearranging yields
#
# $ A^H A x = A^H y$
#
# which is a linear system $Hx = b$ that needs to be solved for $x$. This is done using the conjugate gradient method.
#
# ```{note}
# In Pruessmann, K.P., et al. MRM 2001 (https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.1241) the k-space density is used to reweight the
# loss to achieve faster convergence. This increases reconstruction error, see Ong F., Uecker M., Lustig M. TMI 2020
# (https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2019.2954121). We follow a recommendation by Fessler and Noll
# (https://ece-classes.usc.edu/ee591/library/Fessler-Iterative%20Reconstruction.pdf) and use the DCF to obtain a good
# starting point.

# ## Using `~mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.IterativeSENSEReconstruction`
# First, we demonstrate the use of `~mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.IterativeSENSEReconstruction`, before we
# peek behind the scenes and implement the reconstruction manually.
#
# ## Read-in the raw data
# We read the raw k-space data and the trajectory from the ISMRMRD file
# (see <project:comparison_trajectory_calculators.ipynb> for more information on the trajectory calculation).
# Our example data contains three datasets:
# - ``radial2D_402spokes_golden_angle_with_traj.h5`` with 402 spokes
# - ``radial2D_96spokes_golden_angle_with_traj.h5`` with 96 spokes
# - ``radial2D_24spokes_golden_angle_with_traj.h5`` with 24 spokes
#
# We use the 402 spokes dataset for the reconstruction.

import zenodo_get

dataset = '14617082'

tmp = tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()  # RAII, automatically cleaned up

import mrpro

trajectory_calculator = mrpro.data.traj_calculators.KTrajectoryIsmrmrd()
kdata = mrpro.data.KData.from_file(data_folder / 'radial2D_402spokes_golden_angle_with_traj.h5', trajectory_calculator)

# ## Direct reconstruction for comparison
# For comparison, we first can carry out a direct reconstruction using the
# `~mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.DirectReconstruction` class.
# See also <project:direct_reconstruction.ipynb>.

# %%
direct_reconstruction = mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.DirectReconstruction(kdata)
img_direct = direct_reconstruction(kdata)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Setting up the iterative SENSE reconstruction
# Now let's use the `~mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.IterativeSENSEReconstruction` class to reconstruct the image
# using the iterative SENSE algorithm.
#
# We first set up the reconstruction. Here, we reuse the the Fourier operator, the DCFs and the coil sensitivity maps
# from ``direct_reconstruction``. We use *early stopping* after 4 iterations by setting `n_iterations`.
#
# ```{note}
# When setting up the reconstruction we can also provide the `~mrpro.data.KData` and let
#  `~mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.IterativeSENSEReconstruction` figure
# out the Fourier operator, estimate the coil sensitivity maps, and choose a density weighting.\
# We can also provide `~mrpro.data.KData` and some information, such as the sensitivity maps.
# In that case, the reconstruction will automatically determine the missing information based
# on the `~mrpro.data.KData` object.
# ```

# %%
iterative_sense_reconstruction = mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.IterativeSENSEReconstruction(
    fourier_op=direct_reconstruction.fourier_op,
    csm=direct_reconstruction.csm,
    dcf=direct_reconstruction.dcf,
    n_iterations=4,
)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Run the reconstruction
# We now run the reconstruction using ``iterative_sense_reconstruction`` object. We just need to pass the k-space data
# and obtain the reconstructed image as `~mrpro.data.IData` object.
# %%

img = iterative_sense_reconstruction(kdata)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Behind the scenes
# We now peek behind the scenes to see how the iterative SENSE reconstruction is implemented. We perform all steps
# `~mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.IterativeSENSEReconstruction` does when initialized with only an `~mrpro.data.KData`
# object, i.e., we need to set up a Fourier operator, estimate coil sensitivity maps, and the density weighting.
# without reusing anything from ``direct_reconstruction```.


# %% [markdown]
# ### Set up the acquisition model $A$
# We need `~mrpro.operators.FourierOp` and `~mrpro.operators.SensitivityOp` operators to set up the acquisition model
# $A$. The Fourier operator is created from the trajectory and header information in ``kdata``:

# %%
fourier_operator = mrpro.operators.FourierOp(
    traj=kdata.traj,
    recon_matrix=kdata.header.recon_matrix,
    encoding_matrix=kdata.header.encoding_matrix,
)

# %% [markdown]
# To estimate the coil sensitivity maps, we first calculate the coil-wise images from the k-space data and then
# estimate the coil sensitivity maps using the Walsh method.
# We use the Voronoi tessellation to calculate the density compensation.

# %%
dcf_operator = mrpro.data.DcfData.from_traj_voronoi(kdata.traj).as_operator()
img_coilwise = mrpro.data.IData.from_tensor_and_kheader(*fourier_operator.H(*dcf_operator(kdata.data)), kdata.header)
csm_data = mrpro.data.CsmData.from_idata_walsh(img_coilwise)
csm_operator = csm_data.as_operator()

# %% [markdown]
# Now we can set up the acquisition operator $A$ by composing the Fourier operator and the coil sensitivity maps
# operator using ``@``.

# %%
acquisition_operator = fourier_operator @ csm_operator

# %% [markdown]
# ### Calculate the right-hand-side of the linear system
# Next, we need to calculate $b = A^H y$.

# %%
(right_hand_side,) = acquisition_operator.H(kdata.data)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Set-up the linear self-adjoint operator $H$
# We setup $H = A^H A$ using the `~mrpro.operators.LinearOperator.gram` property.

# %%
operator = acquisition_operator.gram

# %% tags=["hide-cell"]
import torch


def vdot(u: torch.Tensor, v: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    """Dot product of two batched 3d tensors."""
    return torch.linalg.vecdot(u.flatten(start_dim=-3), v.flatten(start_dim=-3))


# %% [markdown]
# ### Choose initial value
# We choose the initial value for the iterative reconstruction based on the density compensated adjoint reconstruction:
# $u = A^H W y$. To account for normalization differences, we scale $u$ by $\frac{u^H u}{u^H A^H W A u}$.
# %%
(u,) = (acquisition_operator.H @ dcf_operator)(kdata.data)
scale = vdot(u, u) / vdot(u, *(acquisition_operator.H @ dcf_operator @ acquisition_operator)(u))
initial_value = u * scale
# %% [markdown]
# ### Run conjugate gradient
# Finally, we solve the linear system $Hx = b$ using the conjugate gradient method.
# Again, we use early stopping after 4 iterations. Instead, we could also use a tolerance
# to stop the iterations when the residual is below a certain threshold.

# %%
(img_manual,) = mrpro.algorithms.optimizers.cg(
    operator, right_hand_side, initial_value=initial_value, max_iterations=4, tolerance=0.0
)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Display the results
# We can now compare the results of the iterative SENSE reconstruction with the direct reconstruction.
# Both versions, the one using the `~mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.IterativeSENSEReconstruction` class
# and the manual implementation should result in identical images.

# We can also reconstruct undersampled data: You can replace the filename above to use a dataset with fewer spokes to
# try it out.\
