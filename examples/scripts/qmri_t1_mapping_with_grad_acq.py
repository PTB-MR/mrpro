# # $T_1$ mapping from a continuous golden radial acquisition


# %% [markdown]
# ### Overview
# In this acquisition, a single inversion pulse is played out, followed by a continuous data acquisition with a
# a constant flip angle $\alpha$. Data acquisition is carried out with a 2D Golden angle radial trajectory. The acquired
# data can be divided into different dynamic time frames, each corresponding to a different inversion time. A signal
# model can then be fitted to this data to obtain a $T_1$ map.
#
# More information can be found in [Kerkering KM et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.29699)

# The number of time frames and hence the number of radial lines per time frame, can in principle be chosen arbitrarily.
# However, a tradeoff between image quality (more radial lines per dynamic) and
# temporal resolution to accurately capture the signal behavior (fewer radial lines) needs to be found.

# %% [markdown]
# During data acquisition, the magnetization $M_z(t)$ can be described by the signal model:
#
# $$
#   M_z(t) = M_0^* + (M_0^{init} - M_0^*)e^{(-t / T_1^*)} \quad (1)
# $$

# %% [markdown]
# where the effective longitudinal relaxation time is given by:
#
# $$
#   T_1^* = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_R} \ln(\cos(\alpha))}
# $$

# %% [markdown]
# and the steady-state magnetization is
#
# $$
#   M_0^* = M_0 \frac{T_1^*}{T_1} .
# $$

# %% [markdown]
# The initial magnetization $M_0^{init}$ after an inversion pulse is $-M_0$. Nevertheless, commonly after an inversion
# pulse, a strong spoiler gradient is played out to remove any residual transversal magnetization due to
# imperfections of the inversion pulse. During the spoiler gradient, the magnetization recovers with $T_1$. Commonly,
# the duration of this spoiler gradient $\Delta t$ is between 10 to 20 ms. This leads to the initial magnetization
#
# $$
#  M_0^{init} = M_0(1 - 2e^{(-\Delta t / T_1)}) .

# In this example, we are going to:
# - Reconstruct a single high quality image using all acquired radial lines.
# - Split the data into multiple dynamics and reconstruct these dynamic images
# - Define a signal model and a loss function to obtain the $T_1$ maps

# ### Signal model
# We use a three parameter signal model $q(M_0, T_1, \alpha)$.
#
# The model needs information about the time $t$, `sampling_time`, in Eq. (1) since the inversion pulse.
# This can be calculated from the `acquisition_time_stamp`. If we average the `acquisition_time_stamp`-values for each
# dynamic image and subtract the first `acquisition_time_stamp`, we get the mean time since the inversion pulse for each
# dynamic. Note: The time taken by the spoiler gradient is taken into consideration in the
# `~mrpro.operators.models.TransientSteadyStateWithPreparation`-model and does not have to be added here.
# ```{note}
# The acquisition_time_stamp is not given in time units but in vendor-specific time stamp units. For the Siemens
# data used here, one time stamp corresponds to 2.5 ms.
# ```

# %%
# Calculate the time since the inversion pulse, taking the average over all radial lines in each dynamic.
sampling_time = kdata_dynamic.header.acq_info.acquisition_time_stamp.squeeze()
sampling_time = (sampling_time - sampling_time[0, 0]).mean(-1)

# %% [markdown]
# We also need the repetition time between two RF-pulses. There is a parameter `tr` in the header, but this describes
# the time "between the beginning of a pulse sequence and the beginning of the succeeding (essentially identical) pulse
# sequence" (see [DICOM Standard Browser](https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/mr-image/mr-image/00180080)). We have one
# inversion pulse at the beginning, which is never repeated and hence ``tr`` is the duration of the entire scan.
# Therefore, we have to use the parameter `~mrpro.data.KHeader.echo_spacing`, which describes the time between
# two gradient echoes.

# %%
if kdata_dynamic.header.echo_spacing is None:
    raise ValueError('Echo spacing needs to be defined.')
else:
    repetition_time = kdata_dynamic.header.echo_spacing[0]

# %% [markdown]
# Finally, we have to specify the duration of the spoiler gradient. Unfortunately, we cannot get this information from
# the acquired data, but we have to know the value and set it by hand to 20 ms. Now we can define the signal model.

# %%
model_op = mrpro.operators.models.TransientSteadyStateWithPreparation(
    sampling_time, repetition_time, m0_scaling_preparation=-1, delay_after_preparation=0.02
)

# %% [markdown]
# The reconstructed image data is complex-valued. We could fit a complex $M_0$ to the data, but in this case it is more
# robust to fit $|q(M_0, T_1, \alpha)|$ to the magnitude of the image data. We therefore combine our model with a
# `~mrpro.operators.MagnitudeOp`.

# %%
magnitude_model_op = mrpro.operators.MagnitudeOp() @ model_op

# %% [markdown]
# ### Constraints
# $T_1$ and $\alpha$ need to be positive. Based on the knowledge of the phantom, we can constrain $T_1$ between 50 ms
# and 3 s. Further, we can constrain $\alpha$. Although the effective flip angle can vary, it can only vary by a
# certain percentage relative to the nominal flip angle. Here, we chose a maximum deviation from the nominal flip angle
# of 50%.
# We use a `~mrpro.operators.ConstraintsOp` to define these constraints. It maps unconstrained parameters to constrained
# parameters, such that the optimizer can work with unconstrained parameters
# %%
if kdata_dynamic.header.fa is None:
    raise ValueError('Nominal flip angle needs to be defined.')

nominal_flip_angle = float(kdata_dynamic.header.fa[0])

constraints_op = mrpro.operators.ConstraintsOp(
    bounds=(
        (None, None),  # M0 is not constrained
        (0.05, 3.0),  # T1 is constrained between 50 ms and 3 s
        (nominal_flip_angle * 0.5, nominal_flip_angle * 1.5),  # alpha is constrained
    )
)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Loss function
# As a loss function for the optimizer, we calculate the mean squared error between the image data $x$ and our signal
# model $q$.
# %%
mse_loss = mrpro.operators.functionals.MSE(img_rss_dynamic)

# %% [markdown]
# Now we can simply combine the loss function, the signal model and the constraints to solve
#
# $$
#  \min_{M_0, T_1, \alpha} || |q(M_0, T_1, \alpha)| - x||_2^2
# $$
# %%
functional = mse_loss @ magnitude_model_op @ constraints_op

# %% [markdown]
# ### Carry out fit
# We use an LBFGS optimizer to minimize the loss function. We start with the following initial values:
# - The intensity at shortest echo time as a good approximation for the equilibrium magnetization $M_0$,
# - 1 s for $T_1$, and
# - nominal flip angle for the actual flip angle.

t1_start = torch.ones_like(m0_start)
flip_angle_start = torch.ones_like(m0_start) * torch.as_tensor(kdata_dynamic.header.fa)
# %% [markdown]
# If we use a `~mrpro.operators.ConstraintsOp`, the start values must be transformed to the
# unconstrained space before the optimization and back to the original space after the optimization.
# %%
initial_parameters = constraints_op.inverse(m0_start, t1_start, flip_angle_start)
# %% [markdown]
# Now we can run the optimizer in the unconstrained space.
# %%
result = mrpro.algorithms.optimizers.lbfgs(functional, initial_parameters=initial_parameters)
# %% [markdown]
# Transforming the parameters back to the original space, we get the final $M_0$, $T_1$, and flip angle:
# %%
m0, t1, flip_angle = (p.detach().cpu().squeeze() for p in constraints_op(*result))
# %% [markdown]
# ## Visualize results
# Finally, we can take a look at the estimated $M_0$, $T_1$, and flip angle maps:

# Great! We have successfully estimated the $T_1$ map from the dynamic images!
#
# ### Next steps
# The quality of the final $T_1$ maps depends on the quality of the individual dynamic images. Using more advanced image
# reconstruction methods, we can improve the image quality and hence the quality of the maps.
# Try to exchange `~mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.DirectReconstruction` above with
# `~mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.IterativeSENSEReconstruction`
# or try a different optimizer such as `~mrpro.algorithms.optimizers.adam`.
