# ### Overview
# In this acquisition a single inversion pulse is played out followed by a continuous acquisition of data with a
# a constant flip angle $\alpha$. Data acquisition is carried out with a 2D Golden angle radial trajectory. The acquired
# data can be split into different dynamic time frames, each obtained at a different inversion time. A signal model can
# then be fit to this data to obtain a $T_1$ map. More information can be found in:
#
# Kerkering KM, Schulz-Menger J, Schaeffter T, Kolbitsch C (2023) Motion-corrected model-based reconstruction for 2D
# myocardial T1 mapping, MRM 90 https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.29699
#
# The number of time frames and hence the number of radial lines per time
# frame can in principle be chosen arbitrarily but a tradeoff between image quality (more radial lines per dynamic) and
# temporal resolution to resolve the signal behaviour accurately (fewer radial lines) needs to be found.
#
# During data acquisition the magnetisation $M_z(t)$ can be described by the signal model:
#   $$ M_z(t) = M_0^* + (M_0^{init} - M_0^*)e^{(-t / T_1^*)} \quad (1) $$
# where the effective longitudinal relaxation time is
#   $$ T_1^* = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{T1} - \frac{1}{T_R} ln(cos(\alpha))} $$
# and the steady-state magnetisation is
#   $$ M_0^* = M_0 \frac{T_1^*}{T_1} .$$
#
# The initial magnetisation $M_0^{init}$ after in inversion pulse is $-M_0$. Nevertheless, commonly after an inversion
# pulse a strong spoiler gradient is played out which removes any residual transversal magnetisation due to
# imperfections of the inversion pulse. During the spoiler gradient the magnetisation recovers with $T_1$. Commonly the
# duration of this spoiler gradient $\Delta t$ is between 10 to 20ms. This leads to the initial magnetisation
#   $$ M_0^{init} = M_0(1 - 2e^{(-\Delta t / T_1)}) .$$
#
# In this example we are going to:
# - Reconstruct a single image using all the acquired radial lines. We do this to check the data but also to utilise all
# the data to obtain a high quality coil sensitivity map.
# - Split the data into multiple dynamics and reconstruct these dynamic images
# - Define a signal model and loss function and obtain the $T_1$ maps

# ### Signal model
# We use a three parameter signal model $q(M_0, T_1, \alpha)$.
#
# As known input the model needs information about the time $t$ (`sampling_time`) in Eq. (1) since the inversion pulse.
# This can be calculated from the `acquisition_time_stamp`. If we average the `acquisition_time_stamp`-values for each
# dynamic image and subtract the first `acquisition_time_stamp`, we get the mean time since the inversion pulse for each
# dynamic. Note: The time taken by the spoiler gradient is taken into consideration in the
# `TransientSteadyStateWithPreparation`-model and does not have to be added here. One important thing to note here is,
# that the `acquisition_time_stamp` is not given in time units but in vendor-specific time stamp units. For the Siemens
# data use here, one time stamp corresponds to 2.5ms.

# %%
sampling_time = torch.mean(kdata_dynamic.header.acq_info.acquisition_time_stamp[:, 0, :, 0].to(torch.float32), dim=-1)
# Subtract time stamp of first radial line
sampling_time -= kdata_dynamic.header.acq_info.acquisition_time_stamp[0, 0, 0, 0]
# Convert to seconds
sampling_time *= 2.5 / 1000

# %% [markdown]
# We also need the repetition time between two RF-pulses. There is a parameter `tr` in the header but this describes the
# time "between the beginning of a pulse sequence and the beginning of the succeeding (essentially identical) pulse
# equence" (see https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/mr-image/mr-image/00180080). We have one inversion pulse at the
# beginning which is never repeated and hence `tr` is the duration of the entire scan. Therefore, we have to use the
# parameter `echo_spacing` which describes the time between two gradient echoes.

# %%
if kdata_dynamic.header.echo_spacing is None:
    raise ValueError('Echo spacing needs to be defined.')
else:
    repetition_time = kdata_dynamic.header.echo_spacing[0]

# %% [markdown]
# Finally, we have to specify the duration of the spoiler gradient. Unfortunately, we cannot get this information from
# the acquired data and we have to know the value and set it by hand to 20ms. Now we can define the signal model.

# %%
model_op = TransientSteadyStateWithPreparation(
    sampling_time, repetition_time, m0_scaling_preparation=-1, delay_after_preparation=0.02
)

# %% [markdown]
# The reconstructed image data is complex-valued. We could fit a complex $M_0$ to the data but in this case it is more
# robust to fit $|q(M_0, T_1, \alpha)|$ to the magnitude of the image data. We therefore combine our model with a
# `MagnitudeOp`.

# %%
magnitude_model_op = MagnitudeOp() @ model_op

# %% [markdown]
# ### Constraints
# $T_1$ and $\alpha$ need to be positive. Based on the knowledge of the phantom we can constrain $T_1$ between 50ms and
# 3s. We can also further constrain $\alpha$ because although the effective flip angle can vary, it can only vary by a
# certain percentage relative to the nominal flip angle. Here we chose a maximum deviation from the nominal flip angle
# of 50%.

# %%
constraints_op = ConstraintsOp(
    bounds=((None, None), (0.05, 3.0), (kdata_dynamic.header.fa * 0.5, kdata_dynamic.header.fa * 1.5))
)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Loss function
# As a loss function for the optimizer, we calculate the mean-squared error between the image data $x$ and our signal
# model $q$.
# %%
mse_loss = MSEDataDiscrepancy(img_rss_dynamic)

# %% [markdown]
# Now we can simply combine the loss function, the signal model and the constraints to solve
#
# $$ \min_{M_0, T_1, \alpha} || |q(M_0, T_1, \alpha)| - x||_2^2$$
# %%
