    "### Image reconstruction\n",
    "We use the `~mrpro.algorithms.reconstruction.RegularizedIterativeSENSEReconstruction` class to reconstruct images\n",
    "from 2D radial data. It solves the following reconstruction problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have obtained the k-space data $y$ from an image $x$ with an acquisition model (Fourier transforms,\n",
    "coil sensitivity maps...) $A$ then we can formulate the forward problem as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y = Ax + n $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ describes complex Gaussian noise. The image $x$ can be obtained by minimizing the functional $F$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ F(x) = ||Ax - y||_2^2 + \\lambda||Bx - x_\\mathrm{reg}||_2^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the strength of the regularization, $B$ is a linear operator and $x_\\mathrm{reg}$ is a\n",
    "regularization image.\n",
    "With this functional $F$ we obtain a solution which is close to $x_\\mathrm{reg}$ and to the acquired data $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting the derivative (see https://www.matrixcalculus.org) of the functional $F$ to zero and rearranging yields\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (A^H A + l B^H B) x = A^H y + \\lambda B^H x_\\mathrm{reg}$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is a linear system $Hx = b$ that needs to be solved for $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important question of course is, what to use as $x_\\mathrm{{reg}}$ and $B$. For dynamic images (e.g. cine MRI)\n",
    "low-resolution dynamic images or high-quality static images have been proposed.\n",
    "In recent years, the output of neural networks has also been used, i.e. $x_{\\mathrm{reg}} = u_{\\theta}(x_0)$\n",
    "$B=\\mathrm{Id}$ for a pre-trained network $u_{\\theta}$ and initial image $x_0$ [[Kofler et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab990e)].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we are going to use a high-quality image to regularize the reconstruction of an undersampled image.\n",
    "Both images are obtained from the same data acquisition - one using all the acquired data ($x_{\\mathrm{reg}}$),\n",
    "and one using only parts of it ($x$). This is, of course, an unrealistic case but it will allow us to demonstrate\n",
    "the effect of the regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "In [Pruessmann et al. 2001](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.1241) the k-space density is used to reweight the\n",

    "We follow a recommendation by [Fessler and Noll](https://ece-classes.usc.edu/ee591/library/Fessler-Iterative%20Reconstruction.pdf)\n",
