    "### Image reconstruction\n",
    "Here, we use a proximal gradient descent algorithm to reconstruct an image\n",
    "from 2D radial k-space data with wavelet regularization.\n",
    "In particular, we use the accelerated version known as FISTA (Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $y$ denote the k-space data of the image $x_{\\mathrm{true}}$ sampled with an acquisition model $A$\n",
    "(Fourier transform, coil sensitivity maps, etc.), i.e the forward problem is given as\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y = Ax_{\\mathrm{true}} + n, $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ describes complex Gaussian noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "As regularization method, here we employ wavelets, which are known to be suitable sparsifying transforms.\n",
    "We consider the following functional $\\mathcal{F}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\mathcal{F}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}||Ax - y||_2^2 + \\lambda \\| W x \\|_1, \\quad \\quad \\quad (1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W$ is the discretized wavelet operator that maps the image domain to the wavelet domain,\n",
    "and $\\lambda >0$ is an appropriate regularization weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimization of the functional $\\mathcal{F}$ is non-trivial due to\n",
    "the non-differentiable $\\ell_1$-norm and the presence of the wavelet operator.\n",
    "A possible algorithm to approach the solution of (1) would be the primal dual hybrid gradient (PDHG)\n",
    "algorithm [[Chambolle \\& Pock, JMIV 2011](https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10851-010-0251-1)].\n",
    "However, exploiting the orthonormality of $W$, we can reformulate $(1)$ to solve the minimization problem\n",
    "in the wavelet domain and use a simpler algorithm. By defining the new variable $\\tilde{x} = Wx$\n",
    "(and thus, due to the orthonormality of $W$, $W^H \\tilde{x} = x$), the minimization problem becomes\n",

    "[[Beck \\& Teboulle, SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences 2009](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/080716542)],\n",
    "which consists of an accelerated proximal gradient descent algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, FISTA can be used to solve problems of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\min_x f(x) + g(x)  \\quad \\quad \\quad (3)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ is a convex, differentiable function with $L$-Lipschitz gradient $\\nabla f$,\n",
    "and $g$ is convex and possibly non-smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main step of the minimization method is a proximal gradient step, which reads as\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{k} = \\mathrm{prox}_{\\sigma g}(x_{k-1} - \\sigma \\nabla f({x}_{k-1}))$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathrm{prox}$ denotes the proximal operator and $\\sigma$ is\n",
    "an appropriate stepsize, ideally $\\sigma=\\frac{1}{L}$, with $L$ being\n",
    "the Lipschitz constant of $\\nabla f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, FISTA has an additional step to accelerate the convergence. The following variable $z_{k+1}$\n",
    "is included, consisting of a linear interpolation\n",
    "of the previous two steps $x_{k}$ and $x_{k-1}$. So, for $t_1=1, z_1=x_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{k} = \\mathrm{prox}_{\\sigma g}(z_{k} - \\sigma \\nabla f({z}_{k}))$\n",

    "\n",
    "$z_{k+1} = x_{k} + \\frac{t_k - 1}{t_{k+1}}(x_{k} - x_{k-1}).$\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Lipschitz constant $L$ is in general not known, and\n",
    "the interval of the stepsize $\\sigma\\in ( 0, \\frac{1}{|| \\tilde{A}^H \\tilde{A}||} )$ is crucial for the convergence,\n",
    "a backtracking step can  be performed to update the stepsize $\\sigma$ at every iteration. To do so,\n",
    "$\\sigma$ is iteratively reduced until reaching a stepsize that is the largest\n",
